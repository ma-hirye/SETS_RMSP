This repository is intended to contain all databases and codes used in the paper "Assessing Landslide Drivers in 
Social–Ecological–Technological Systems: The Case of Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, Brazil"

Disasters database used in this paper are available online: https://www.infraestruturameioambiente.sp.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/sites/233/2017/12/Cad_Desastres_Shapefile_50mun.zip. 

Rainfall data is available online: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UCSB-CHG_CHIRPS_DAILY. 

Digital elevation model (DEM), with 10 m spatial resolution, was derived from the digital planimetric and topographic map of MRSP, with 25 m contours and a spatial scale compatible to 1:25,000, using a triangulated irregular network (TIN) calculated based on contour lines, measured points, and a river net-work. It is available in "DEM" folder.

Physical Mass Movement Susceptibility was estimated based on geological, geomorphological, and hydrological–pedological conditions, by the Geological Survey of Brazil (“Companhia de Pesquisa de Re-cursos Minerais”—CPRM), for all municipalities in MRSP, except Vargem Grande Paulista, Pirapora do Bom Jesus, Juquitiba, and São Lourenço da Serra. It is available in "SUSC" folder.

Land Cover Data: classes of vegetation, built up areas, bare soil, and water were mapped from Landsat TM, at a spatial resolution of 30 m, using Landsat Collection Tier 1, processed and made available by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), for 2000 and 2010.

Socio-economic data is available online: https://centrodametropole.fflch.usp.br/pt-br/download-de-dados and https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/populacao/22827-censo-demografico.html?=&t=downloads.
